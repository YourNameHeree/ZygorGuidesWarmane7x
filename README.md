Guide for Warmane's 7x realms
To start using this guide, put the linked file in the Guides folder, which should be located in the ZygorGuidesViewer folder addon.
Keep in mind as shown in the images, you'll have to manually select the guide from the addon window depending on your current level and race. Example being if you play a Night Elf, you'll have to choose "1-10 Night Elf" from the drop down menu of the addon window. You'll also need to uncheck "Skip obsolete steps" and you may have to allow 80 levels ahead as well. There are still some kinks that'll have to be worked out.
